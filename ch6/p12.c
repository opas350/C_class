/* However, we are allowed to pass a pointer to the structure as an actual parameter. Look at the example on the right â†’ , only slightly different from the previous one.

This function expects a pointer to the structure, not the structure itself. The pointer is of type struct STR *. Consequently, the function doesn't use the dot operator any more. The arrow must be used instead and the output screen will look as follows:

    2 B
