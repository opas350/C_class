The ## operator

The ## operator is a binary operator requiring two arguments and is used in the following way →

It causes the texts retrieved from the arguments to be “glued” (concatenated), thus, will transform the initial expression to the following form:

     argument1argument2

Note that such effect cannot be achieved in any other way because a macro similar to the following:

     #define GLUE (X,Y) XY

will not work. The preprocessor recognizes the XY identifier, not X and Y. 

Here is the correct solution:

     #define GLUE(X,Y)  X##Y

The GLUE macro used in the following way:

     GLUE(MaryHad, ALittleLamb)

will be expanded to the form:

     MaryHadALittleLamb
